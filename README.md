## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a programmer with a background in C programming and a passion for systems and language design.

- **ðŸ”§ Background**: I started my programming journey with C, where I developed a deep understanding of memory management and performance-driven coding. Since 2015, Iâ€™ve been studing Rust, which has become my go-to language for my own projects. I enjoy how Rust combines safety, performance, and ease of use, making it ideal for building robust and efficient applications.

- **ðŸ’¼ Day-to-Day**: Professionally, I focus on backend development with Python. Working on back-office systems and handling event-driven architectures keeps me engaged with modern backend tech.

- **ðŸš€ Projects**: My GitHub is where you'll find projects ranging from Rust crates to explorations in new programming languages. I love experimenting with language design, trying out new paradigms, and creating tools that make development faster and more enjoyable.

- **ðŸ¤“ Interests**: My passion lies in programming languages. In my spare time, Iâ€™m often building interpreters, and tooling for languages I design myself. Itâ€™s a way to stay constantly learning and pushing my skills. When I'm not programming I like to strum my guitar or take walks outside.
